# Name mangling in Python is a mechanism that changes the name of class attributes that are prefixed with double underscores (__) to make them harder to access from outside the class. Itâ€™s used to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses and enforce a stronger sense of "private" access.
# it is not for true security though 

# the "consenting adults" philosophy
