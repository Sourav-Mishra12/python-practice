# Name mangling in Python is a mechanism that changes the name of class attributes that are prefixed with double underscores (__) to make them harder to access from outside the class. Itâ€™s used to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses and enforce a stronger sense of "private" access.
# it is not for true security though 

# the "consenting adults" philosophy


# static attributes

# A Static attribute (sometimes called as a class attribute) is an attribute that belongs to the class itself , not to any specific instance of the class.

# tracking the number of the objects that are created from a class

class user:
     user_count = 0   #static attribute

# instance attributes are unique to each object and are accssessd within a class , theyre ideal for storing user specific data

# static attributes are shared among all objects of the class and can be accessed with class name . attribute name theyre ideal for storing data that needs to be specific across all instances

# static methods 

# a static method in python is a method that belongs to  the class itself rather than any instance of the class

# to define a static method we use the '@staticmethod' decorator

# both types of methods are stored in the class
